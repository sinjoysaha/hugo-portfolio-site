## Abstract

Traditional methods of healthcare demand the patient to visit the clinic on a regular basis. These conventional methods can be quite cumbersome for both the patient as well as the medical staff. The focus of this paper is to implement a smart IoT-based health monitoring system which uses noninvasive sensors to read different health parameters and displays it instantly on an LCD module. Additionally, the user has the option of sending the data to the cloud to store it securely. The stored data can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world. Low cost, portable, user-friendly interface and ease of data visualization are some of the key features of this system.
